the maximum strength Ive can ge




int ans = 0, curr = 0;

// The superhero can choose one complete array and he can add the elements of the array to his strength.
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    curr += array1[i] - array2[i];
    if(curr < 0) curr = 0;
    ans = max(ans, curr);
}
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    ans += array2[i];
}
int other = 0;
curr = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    curr += array2[i] - array1[i];
    if(curr < 0) curr = 0;
    other = max(other, curr);
}
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    other += array1[i];
}
return max(ans, other);
